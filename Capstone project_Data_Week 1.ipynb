    "### 1.\tIntroduction\n",
    "#### 1.1\tBackground\n",
    "Road crash fatalities and disabilities have become very common these days and is recognised as a major public health issue. Approximately 1.35 million people die and 30-50 million suffer non-fatal injuries in every year from road accidents globally. There are different factors that cause road accidents, including speeding, weather, time, road conditions etc. Data analytics has emerged as a great technique that allows data scientists to extract meaningful information from a large set of data. Accident modelling on the different contributing factors of road accidents could provide an insight into the leading conditions for road accidents. \n",
    "#### 1.2\tProblem \n",
    "In this project, road accident data for Washington state has been analysed. Machine learning techniques have been used on road accident data for King county to build a model which can be used for real time accident prediction for the same county. \n",
    "#### 1.3 Interest\n",
    "People who live in Washington state, especially the drivers would be very interested in real time accident prediction so that they can drive more carefully or change their route. People from other states would also be interested in this analysis since they can also avoid similar travel situations to prevent accidents. \n",
    "### 2.\tData acquisition and cleaning\n",
    "#### 2.1 Data sources\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle website and can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The dataset consists of traffic collision events from 2006 to 2020 for the 49 states of United States of America (USA) and it contains 3513617 rows and 49 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Data cleaning\n",
    "The dataset available from Kaggle website was generated by combining the traffic event data from several providers. The columns containing Start_Time and End_time character data was converted to date/time data type. The amount of time was extracted in minutes for each accident and after that time duration values were checked for negative numbers if any. The outliers were set to not a number (NAN) and the negative time duration rows were dropped. \n",
    "2.3 Feature selection\n",
    "The original dataset contains 49 features. After the preliminary data analysis, only the relevant features were selected based on their impact on accidents.  The following 34 features were selected for the improved accuracy of the prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "feature_lst=['Source','TMC','Severity','Start_Lng','Start_Lat','Distance(mi)','Side','City','County','State','Timezone','Temperature(F)','Humidity(%)','Pressure(in)','Visibility(mi)','Wind_Direction','Weather_Condition','Amenity','Bump','Crossing','Give_Way','Junction','No_Exit','Railway','Roundabout','Station','Stop','Traffic_Calming','Traffic_Signal','Turning_Loop','Sunrise_Sunset','Hour','Weekday', 'Time_Duration(min)']\n",
